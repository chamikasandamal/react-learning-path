        npx create-next-app@latest

  - ### Remix
     [Remix](https://remix.run/) is a full-stack React framework with nested routing. It lets you break your app into nested parts that can load data in parallel and refresh in response to the user actions.

        npx create-remix
    If you’re new to Remix, check out the Remix [blog tutorial](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/tutorials/blog) (short) and [app tutorial](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/tutorials/jokes) (long).
